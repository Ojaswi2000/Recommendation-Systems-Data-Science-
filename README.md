# Recommendation System for Movies using Correlation(Data Science)
This project builds a simple recommendation system for movies using data science concepts in Python. It uses correlation techniques for recommending movies for 'Star Wars' and 'Liar Liar' movies. It also uses matplotlib and seaborn libraries for data visualization and the dataset used for the project is a subset of The 'MovieLens' dataset.  

# The Corrwith Function
This project uses the simplest technique for recommending movies to the users using the correlation function corrwith(). This function builds a correlation for the movies: 'Star Wars' and 'Liar Liar' and uses the concept of collaborative filtering for recommendation.
